# ORM Ecommerce Backend Route Handler

My project aims to create an application running entirely in node by using express and insomnia for validation. By following the given template that allows a user to have object relational mapping through the use of Mysql tables and sequelize to ensure that you can have the basic CRUD architecture setup when it comes to setting up a virtual environment that would recreate a system of tags and products.

## Installation

There are no specific installation instructions outside of cloning the repo to your VS code and running the appropriate npm commands in your terminal. You may have to download and run insomnia to test the backend routes.

  ## Usage

The usage for the project is done through the terminal by seeding the tables and running the server. Then you can use a program like insomnia to see if the routes get triggered and respond with the appropriate preview.
